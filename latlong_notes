You are listening to “Latitude Longitude (Riots)”.

It is an infinite generative audio composition that is based on the latitude 
and longitude coordinates of these locations.

Using open source tone generating software,
the latitude and longitude coordinates make up a chord (for example, tone values 
42.33 & 83.09 (Rosa Parks & Clairmont)). 

A random value is generated to create tone variations and space between chords.
